# Flatbed Script
Flatbed script for YimMenu _[WIP]_

> [!WARNING]
> This is still a work in progress. Do not use in public sessions.

## General Knowledge:
- If you are not inside a flatbed truck, the script will let you know that you have to spawn one and will provide you with a button to do so.
- ✅ **Vehicles you can tow:**
  - Your personal vehicle (online and single player).
  - NPC vehicles (you can kidnap npcs).
- ❌ **Vehicles you can not tow:**
  - Other players' personal vehicles.
  - Police vehicles.
  - Boats, planes and helicopters.
    > _Mission vehicles? I'm not sure, I haven't tested them._

## Known Issues:
- Towed vehicle position is not consistent. Some will clip through the flatbed and others will sit higher.

## To Do:
- [ ] Fix position of towed vehicles based on vehicle's size or class.
- [ ] Use another logic for finding nearby vehicles, therefore including more if not all GTA vehicles. *(Towing a plane still won't make sense though but whatever)*
